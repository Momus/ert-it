*** Intro
    A wrapper for ert to easily run tests.

*** About this Project
    Uses Babel Org, everything, including the `README.md` file, is
    generated form a single file, `ert-it.org,` where all the changes should go.

* TODO The Plan
*** [100%] Bare minimum to be useful
    - [X] In a .el file:
      - [X] find a corresponding buffer named *-test.el
      - [X] evaluate it. The whole thing
      - [X] feed it to ert

*** [0%] Next Steps
    - [ ] search subdirectories
    - [ ] get all *-test.el files
    - [ ] look for any tests in the current buffer. Evaluate those functons.

* ert-it

    ;; It!\" runs through your head.

    Then evaluate and feed it into \\[ert]."
